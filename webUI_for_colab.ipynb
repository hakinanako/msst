        "This is a webUI for [Music-Source-Separation-Training](https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training), which is a music source separation training framework. You can use this webUI to infer the MSST model and UVR VR.Models (The inference code comes from [python-audio-separator](https://github.com/nomadkaraoke/python-audio-separator), and we do some changes on it), and the preset process page allows you to customize the processing flow yourself. When used on the cloud, you don't need to download the model yourself. WebUI will automatically download the model you need. Finally, we also provide some convenient tools such as [SOME: Vocals to MIDI](https://github.com/openvpi/SOME/) in the webUI."
